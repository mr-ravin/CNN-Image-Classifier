# CNN-Image-Classifier
Classifying images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).  The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. Preprocess of the images, then training a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images are normalized and the labels are one-hot encoded.  You'll get to see the convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.  At the end, you'll get to see the neural network's predictions on the sample images.
